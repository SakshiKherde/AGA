# ðŸ›’ Retail Recommendations with Graph Analytics

This project explores how **graph analytics** can improve product recommendations in retail using the Instacart dataset. By modeling products and their co-purchase behavior as a graph, we uncover meaningful patterns that help drive smarter, more personalized suggestions.

###  Graph Construction
- Converts Instacart shopping data into a product-product graph.
- Edges represent products frequently purchased together.

###  Applied Graph Algorithms
- **Louvain Community Detection**: Surfaces natural product clusters like "snacks" or "breakfast staples".
- **PageRank**: Identifies key products that act as bridges between clustersâ€”great for cross-selling.
- **Node Similarity**: Finds behaviorally similar products to power "customers also bought" recommendations.

###  Recommendation Use Cases
- One-to-one product suggestions
- Bundle recommendations
- Strategic upselling and cross-category navigation

### Find the data 
- The data is in this github repo.
